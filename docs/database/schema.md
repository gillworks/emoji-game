## Stored Procedures

### cleanup_player(player_id UUID, server_id UUID)

Removes a player's data from a server:

- Deletes their position from player_positions
- Removes them from server_players

### handle_cleanup_request()

API endpoint for cleanup_player that uses the authenticated user's ID

### reset_server_map(server_id UUID)

Resets all tiles on a server back to their original terrain:

- Updates terrain_type to match original_terrain_type for all tiles
- Only accessible to authenticated users

### handle_item_action(player_id UUID, item_slot INTEGER, x INTEGER, y INTEGER, server_id UUID)

Handles item usage on terrain:

- Checks if action is valid for item/terrain combination
- Applies success rate and random quantities
- Updates inventory with gathered resources
- Tracks hits for transformation
- Returns success/failure message

### handle_crafting(p_player_id UUID, p_recipe_id UUID, p_x INTEGER DEFAULT NULL, p_y INTEGER DEFAULT NULL, p_server_id UUID DEFAULT NULL)

Handles both item crafting and structure building:

- For regular crafting (when p_x, p_y, p_server_id are NULL):

  - Verifies player has required ingredients
  - Removes ingredients from inventory
  - Adds crafted item to inventory
  - Returns success/failure message

- For structure building (when all parameters provided):
  - Validates building location and terrain type
  - Verifies player has required ingredients
  - Removes ingredients from inventory
  - Updates map terrain and adds structure metadata
  - Returns success/failure message

Parameters:

- p_player_id: Player performing the action
- p_recipe_id: Recipe being used
- p_x: X coordinate for structure placement (optional)
- p_y: Y coordinate for structure placement (optional)
- p_server_id: Server ID for structure placement (optional)

Returns JSON with:

- success: boolean indicating if action succeeded
- message: Status or error message

### map_data (Updated)

Now includes structure metadata
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| metadata | jsonb | Structure metadata including: |
| | | - owner_id: UUID of structure builder |
| | | - built_at: Timestamp of construction |

## Indexes

The following indexes improve query performance:

- idx_player_positions_player_server on player_positions(player_id, server_id)
- idx_player_positions_server on player_positions(server_id)
- idx_server_players_server on server_players(server_id)
- idx_server_players_combined on server_players(server_id, player_id)

## Realtime Subscriptions

The following tables have realtime enabled:

- player_positions (for live player movement, filtered by server_id)

## Initial Data

The database is seeded with:

- Basic terrain types (FOREST, MOUNTAIN, PLAIN, OCEAN, EMPTY_FOREST)
- Default encounter rates in game_configs (including EMPTY_FOREST)
